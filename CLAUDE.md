## Project
- Angular 21 with standalone components
- State management: NgRx Signal Store
- UI: Angular Material with custom theme
- API: REST with HttpClient + httpResource()
- Testing: Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e)

## Conventions
- Feature-based folder structure: feature-name/{component,service,store,model,routes}
- All components use OnPush change detection
- API calls through services, never directly in components
- Barrel exports (index.ts) for every feature folder
- Add JSDoc comments to any new or changed functions

## Commands
- `npm run test` – Run Vitest
- `npm run e2e` – Run Playwright
- `npm run lint` – ESLint check
- `npm run build` – Production build

## Avoid
- No NgModules, no CommonModule imports
- No constructor injection
- No *ngIf/*ngFor (use @if/@for)
- No subscribe() in components
